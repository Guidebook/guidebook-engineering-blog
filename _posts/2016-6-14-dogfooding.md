Guidebook has a relationship with the [PyCon Organization](https://www.python.org/community/pycon/) in which we power the app for [their largest event](https://us.pycon.org/2016/) in exchange for attendee tickets for our developers. This was a great opportunity for our team to learn more about Python as well as experience our product from the attendee perspective. While I was more excited for the former, it was my experiences with the latter which had the greatest impact and served as the motivation for this post.

## Put Yourself In the Position of Your Users
Dogfooding references a scenario in which a company _actually uses_ the same product it builds and sells. At Guidebook, we're fortunate to work on a product that provides immense value for event attendees and _can actually be experienced_ by everyone within our company with a bit of work.

>>> Nothing gets you closer to the perspective of your users than becoming one of them.

While the conference itself was interesting, I found that I got more value out of seeing and feeling the attendee experience firsthand. What follows are the key takeaways I had from eating our own dog food.



**1. Dogfooding Facilitates A Deeper Understanding Of The Product:**
By using our product as an event attendee, I quickly become familiar with the pain points in our product. For instance, how many of us have added a session to the "My Schedule" section of the app? Did you set an alert? Did you set the same alert for _every single session within the guide_? Is there an opportunity for us to optimize that workflow?

Conversely, dogfooding also helps identify value. For instance, after using the app to navigate the conference, it was readily apparent that the ability to add upcoming sessions to my schedule, coupled with detailed location information of each session was a huge value add and something we should continue to tune.

In both cases, I now have a much deeper understanding of _how_ an end user interacts with our product. I know which sections of the guide are important to them and I have a better understanding of the workflows that hamstring their experience. Seeing this first hand had a more meaningful impact than any analytics report could ever inform.


**2. Dogfooding Fosters A Deeper Connection With Our Users:**
Attending a conference in which Guidebook was responsible for the attendee experience presented me with a heightened sense of accountability for that experience.

>>> The gap between developer and user can be enormous.
It's a canyon, and it takes serious effort to cross it.

I became acutely aware of even the smallest bugs and limitations and felt an amplified sense of responsibility to address them.


**3. Dogfooding Provides Motivation For Us To Improve:** Overhearing praise and pains from other event goers is both enlightening and motivating. Getting such direct feedback provides a different sense of motivation and ownership to continue to add value via improvements we can make to our product.


## Product Insights
After spending a week plus with the app and talking to numerous attendees at the conference, I came away with a handful of insights that had never occurred to me before (or had been weighted differently in my mind).

* **Content Is King:** The content within a guide and the architecture of that content are as important as the product itself. The ability for a user to quickly understand and navigate the information within a guide is of the upmost importance and we should do everything in our power to make it easy for guide builders (internally and externally) to build great looking, coherent guides for their attendees.
* **We Need To Get Guidebook Into More Hands:** There were a lot of people at the event that weren't using Guidebook. Some attendees were carrying paper schedules, some were opening their laptops and navigating to the schedule on the PyCon website. After inspecting the download metrics, we had a ~50% adoption rate for the guide at this particular conference. This blew my mind (I thought we'd be at >75% usage) and got me thinking about ways we can improve this metric. We need to do a better job ensuring that attendees are well informed about Guidebook, that our promotional tools are effective and the event planners actually leverage them to get Guidebook into the hands of their attendees.
* **The Schedule Is The Focus:** The schedule was the most widely used section of the guide, garnering >60% usage compared to all other guide sections. Knowing this, we should think of ways to improve that module and make it as easy as possible for attendees to find and add sessions relevant to their experience.


## Homework
Think of different ways you can work your company's products into your everyday life. It will help you empathize with your users and quickly find the most effective optimizations you can make to solve their needs.

For Guidebook employees, we are in the unique position in which we can kill two birds with one stone. Guidebook has budget for learning and development experiences, so go find a conference in an area that you're passionate about, figure out how Guidebook can be involved as the app provider for the event and attend.

Ask your manager and go experience our product first hand.
